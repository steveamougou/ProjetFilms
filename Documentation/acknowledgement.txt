A lot of the code was taken and modified from websites like stack overflow or programming tutorials
Sadly, could not keep track of all sources. Here are some that were kept:
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html
https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction.
https://datatofish.com/sql-to-pandas-dataframe/
https://stackoverflow.com/

I would also like to thank some of my peers who helped for different steps of the projets.

Dr. Hanganu should also be thanked for providing the training for said project
